Changes from ver 1.0-1 to ver 1.0-2  (2020-05-04)

1) Bug fix in "summary.gsm" for models with null space dimension of one
	* Previously resulted in an error during the SE calculation
	* Now correctly calculates the null space SE with nsdf == 1

2) Bug fix in "summary.gsm" for binomial with factor response variable
	* Previously resulted in an error when calculating deviance residuals
	* Now correctly calculates deviance residuals with factor responses 

3) Bug fix in "predict.sm" and "predict.gsm" for multi-dimensional thin-plates
	* Previously resulted in an error when checking new data
	* Now correctly checks new data and creates predictions

4) Bug fix in "pred_rkhs" (internal function) which affected TPS predictions
	* Previously resulted in error due to lack of initializing Qcont
	* Now correctly initializes Qcont, which avoids the error

5) Improvements to "plotci" function for plotting 'x' as a factor
	* Previously converted factors to integers for plotting
	* Now plots factors with points and error bars (default)

6) Updates to references (added details for Helwig SAGE RMF entry)




Changes from ver 1.0-0 to ver 1.0-1  (2019-12-09)

1) Improvement to "gsm" function for binomial responses
	* Now allows the response variable to be a factor
	* First level is a failure, and others are successes

2) Bug fix in "build_rkhs" for parametric effects of factors
	* Previously provided incorrect namespace to model.matrix
	* Now correctly forms model.matrix for parametric factors

3) Bug fix in "sm" and "gsm" for tprk = FALSE and rank deficient knots
	* Previously produced an error if 1 unique knot per predictor
	* Now correctly computes solution in such cases

4) Bug fix in "summary.gsm" for deviance residuals
	* Previously was returning working residuals from fit object
	* Now correctly outputs the deviance residuals from summary

5) Bug fix in "ss" and "summary.ss" for models with m = 1 and/or and periodic = TRUE
	* Previously resulted in an error during post-processing
	* Now correctly post-processes the result with m = 1 and/or periodic = TRUE

6) Improvement to knot selection method for "ss" when all.knots = FALSE
	* Previously used quantiles of x (instead of observed x)
	* Now uses the observed x values to ensure a "true" smoothing spline

7) Bug fix in "sm" and "summary.sm" for models with null space dimension of one
	* Previously resulted in an error during post-processing
	* Now correctly post-processes the result with nsdf == 1

8) Improvement to "plot.ss" for models with non-equidistant x values
	* Previously fit and CI were plotted at observed x values
	* Now fit and CI are plotted at equidistant x values

9) Updates to references (added Helwig SAGE RMF entry)
